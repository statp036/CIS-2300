Project
Create a turn-based text game with fantasy characters.
Requirements:
Game Objective: The game should have a clear objective that is achievable through
text-based interactions with various fantasy characters. For example, the player could be
tasked with saving a kingdom from an evil force or retrieving a magical artifact.
Character Creation: Allow players to create their own unique character by selecting a race,
class, and other character attributes like skills and abilities using your Character class.
Map: The game should create a small, immersive fantasy world with various rooms and
places. It may be, e.g., one large building, multiple small ones, a village, or a spaceship.
Non-Player Characters (NPCs): The game can have a few NPCs to offer quests, provide useful
information, hinder the player's progress, or be enemies for combat.
Dialogue System: Create a dialogue system that allows the player to engage in conversations
with NPCs. It should have at least two outcomes per conversation.
Combat System: If all else fails, fight! Create a turn-based combat system that allows players
to battle enemies with their character's skills and abilities.
Inventory System: Characters should have an inventory system that allows players to collect
and manage items, such as weapons and armor.
User Interface: The game should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. The
interface should be optimized for text-based interactions, with clear menus and options.
